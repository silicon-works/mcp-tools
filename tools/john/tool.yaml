  crack:
    description: "Crack password hashes using john's wordlist mode with optional mangling rules. Writes hashes to a temp file, runs john with the specified wordlist and format, then runs john --show to collect cracked results. Uses AVX2 acceleration when available. The 'rockyou' wordlist (14M passwords) is the default and cracks most weak passwords. With rules enabled (default), john applies word mangling transformations (capitalization, number appending, leet speak, etc.) which dramatically increases coverage. John stores cracked passwords in ~/.john/john.pot — subsequent calls for the same hash return instantly from the pot file."
    when_to_use: "After extracting password hashes from any source: /etc/shadow (Linux), SAM/NTDS.dit/secretsdump (Windows), database dumps (MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL), web application databases, Kerberos tickets (kerberoasting). Always specify the format if you know it — auto-detection works but can be slow or wrong with ambiguous hashes. Common workflow: (1) Extract hashes (e.g., from /etc/shadow, sqlmap dump, impacket secretsdump), (2) Identify format if unsure, (3) Crack with rockyou, (4) If no results, try 'common' wordlist (john's password.lst) with rules for faster iteration. For bcrypt/scrypt hashes, expect very slow cracking (minutes per password) — reduce timeout expectations. For simple MD5/SHA hashes, rockyou with rules cracks most weak passwords in under a minute."

For multiple hashes, separate with newlines. John auto-detects the format from the hash structure."

Enabled by default. Disable for raw wordlist-only testing (faster but less coverage)."

For bcrypt ($2a$, cost 10+): each hash takes ~0.01s to test, so 14M wordlist takes ~40 hours — use 'common' wordlist instead. For NTLM: very fast, 300s is more than enough for rockyou."

Useful for: (1) checking if hashes were already cracked in a previous crack call, (2) retrieving results after a timeout, (3) checking the pot file after manual cracking."
    when_to_use: "After a crack attempt (especially one that timed out) to check what was cracked. Also use when you have the same hashes and want to see if they were cracked in a previous session. John's pot file persists across calls within the same container session, so all previously cracked passwords are retrievable. If crack returns 0 results but you suspect it worked (e.g., you saw progress in raw_output), call show to check the pot file."

If no pattern matches, falls back to probing 8 john formats. Returns a list of possible format names."
    when_to_use: "When you have a hash but don't know its format — e.g., found a hash in a config file, database, or web application and need to determine the correct john format name before cracking. Pattern matching handles most common formats instantly. If this method returns 'unknown', try the hash-lookup tool or check hash format references online. For hashes from specific sources (MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc.), the format is usually known from context."

The output hash can be passed directly to the crack method."
    when_to_use: "When you have an encrypted file and need to crack its password. Common scenarios: (1) Found an encrypted SSH private key — use file_type='ssh' to extract the hash, then crack it. (2) Found a password-protected ZIP file — use file_type='zip'. (3) Found a KeePass database — use file_type='keepass'. (4) Found an Ansible vault — use file_type='ansible'.
